Before starting the server, ensure you connect to your database and review the queries in the routes folder, modifying them if needed to match your database structure.
Create a ".env" file in the root directory of the project and replace the placeholder values with your actual database redentials:

DB_HOST="your_host_value", 
DB_DATABASE="your_database_name",
DB_USER="your_username",
DB_PASSWORD="your_password".

After that, start the server by running "npm start".
Finally, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the application, allowing you to check and test the system.
